1. Install kubuntu 24.04.1 from the iso (on USB or DVD) from

 https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/24.04.1/release/kubuntu-24.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso

Select 'orthanc' as the user, 'orthanc' as the password.
Everything should be the 'default' and you should have
it erase whatever target installation media you are using.
Check the box that says automatically log in after boot.

Note that there seems to be a bug sometimes with previously installed media,
so starting with erased target media is the safest.

2. After booting up the installed system, do the following:

Open a Kconsole window (look under Favorites under the selection lower left) and enter:

  sudo apt install https://feralsw.com/cdw/kp-report-0.9.1.deb

You will be prompted for the orthanc password- enter it. This should install all
of the main Orthanc binaries plus our changes.

3. Open up firefox (click on the rightmost icon on the toolbar below)

It will open a bunch ad-ware tabs. Create a new tab and delete those others.
Enter 'http://localhost:8042' in the address bar. That shoudl bring up the
main Orthanc screen. After it does this, bookmark this page on the bookmarks
toolbar in Firefox for convenience of startup.

4. Correct blank screen after reboot issue

Extra credit- reboot gets you a blank screen. A power cycle solves the
problem. This change is a temp workaround for the problem:

Edit the file /etc/default/grub with your favorite editor using sudo, e.g.:

  sudo nano /etc/default/grub

go to the line that has 'quiet splash' to the right of an equal sign and
remove the 'splash' word. Write and quite.

Then do
  sudo update-grub


5. Keep the system from going to lockscreen

Click the settings icon (2nd one from the left on bottom bar) and go to Power Management
and uncheck the Suspend Session and Screen Energy Saving buttons.

6. Open viewer in a separate window

If you want spin up viewer in a separate window, go into Firefox settings and uncheck
the box that says "open in tabs instead of separate windows".
