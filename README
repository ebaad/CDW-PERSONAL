This is the top of the kp-report source tree. It is a work in progress.

We have one sub-package to build, manually- ReportPlugin. Go to that
directory and look at BUILD and follow the steps there.


At the end of the building the sub-packages, go into Installation and
type 'make'. This will produce a .deb package suitable for use with
dpkg or apt install on Ubuntu 24.04.
