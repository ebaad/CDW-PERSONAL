NOTE: This is not for a HIPAA compliant publicly releasable version of
CODE DARK. This embeds the mountable filesystem for data storage as just
another partition on the USB key. This is being done because alpha testers
are having difficulty with the concept of setting up a separate USB (e.g.,
the Acorn) for running with so testing is not being adequately done yet-
so we'll make it easy for the moment.

0. Required Hardware

Get a 16 GB USB flash drive to install the kubuntu install image on.
Get a 16 or 32GB USB Key to become the target of the install. 

1. Copy kubuntu 24.04.1 from the iso image:

 https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/24.04.1/release/kubuntu-24.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso

*NOTE: Current image is a 24.04 prior to 24.04.1 and is no longer actually findable*

Create an install USB key from this. Boot it.

Select 'orthanc' as the user, 'orthanc' as the password.
Select the full installation option. Erase the whole disk.

Reboot when done.

2. Upgrade kernel

Upgrade the kernel packages to get the amdgpu driver fixes for multiple monitors.

3. System Control panel changes

Go to Power Management and uncheck the Suspend Session and Screen Energy Saving buttons.
Enable shutdown on power button press.

Go to Workspace Behaviour and then go to Screen Locking.
Uncheck the Lockscreen Automatically button.

Go to system settings for KDE Wallet and uncheck enable KDE Wallet box.
You will have to enter orthanc's password for authentication.

#
# Disable systray notifications

Right click over down arrow on bottom bar to the right and configure
notifications for system tray to almost everything hidden or disabled

#
Edit /etc/default/grub and remove splash/quiet for default options,
then do update-grub.

#

#
systemctl mask systemd-timesyncd.service

sed 'g/APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists/s/1/0/' /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades
sed 'g/APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade/s/1/0/' /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades

#
# Set wallpaper to plain color gray-like
#
Do this via right click on desktop to configure it. (*- needs fixing as this only does one screen at a time)

# Make sure we have a data drive
Attach and unlock a CODE_DARK labeled data storage device.

   *or*

# Use local insecure data storage for development testing
Issue the following commands:

   mkdir -p /code_dark/{reports,database,config}
   chown -R orthanc:orthanc /code_dark

4. Configure the installed firefox

Remove crap buttons from bookmark bar
Settings/General
 Check open previous windows and tabs
 Unclick "Open links in new tabs instead of new windows"
Settings/Home
 Set both Homepage and new tabs as blank page
 Uncheck Shortcuts Recommended Stories 

Enter “about:config” in the address search bar
Type “full” in the search bar, and toggle “full-screen-api.enabled” to “false”:


5. Fetch latest kp-report package

https://feralsw.com/cdw/kp-report-latest.deb
sudo apt install -y ./kp-report-latest.deb

This should install all of the main Orthanc binaries plus our changes and additions.

6. Link to the desktop some helpers.

Open the Applications menu (icon to the leftmost on the bottom bar) by left clicking on it.
Enter SetSystemTime in the search bar at the top. It should bring up SetSystemTime Helper
with a 'key' icon. Do a 'right click' over that brought up item and click the '+'
to left of "Add to Desktop".

7. Final steps

# Point google browser to orthanc page
#
Enter http://localhost:8042 in chrome and bookmark it
Leave the browser open so it shows up on reboot
