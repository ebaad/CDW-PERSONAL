DATA KEY CREATION, version 2

These are the initial instructions for creating the data storage
device for the CDW workstation. It is intended for the Apricorn
secure storage device, but can be, for prototype purposes, applied
to any USB storage device.

1. Requirements

A 2GB or better USB device- USB 3.1 or newer.
A PC running Windows - 10 or 11 is fine.

2. Format

Insert the device (unlock it if it's an Apricorn) into the PC.
Format it via the Explorer:

 + Select NTFS type
 + Add CODE_DARK as the filesystem/volume label.

3. Create subdirectories

After formatting, create the following empty directories at the top
level of the newly formatted volume:

  reports
  config
  database
