0. Required Hardware

Get a  8GB USB flash drive to install the ubuntu install image on.
Get a 16GB USB Key to become the target of the install. 

1. Copy Ubuntu 24.04.2 from the iso image:

 https://nnenix.mm.fcix.net/ubuntu-releases/24.04.2/ubuntu-24.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso
 sha256sum: d7fe3d6a0419667d2f8eff12796996328daa2d4f90cd9f87aa9371b362f987bf

Create an install USB key from this with dd on a linux system. Boot it on
a system with no active network connection (important!).

Select "Do not connect to the internet"

Select 'Saruman B Orthanc' as the name. Select 'orthanc' as the name of the system.
Select 'orthanc' as the user, 'orthanc' as the password.
Select the defaults and erase the whole disk and install it.
Keep selection to require user password to log in.

Reboot to installed USB key when the install is done.

While rebooting, reconnect network cable.

Attach CODE_DARK USB storage (and unlock it) after it appears the system is almost up.

2. Install our user level packages

After we come up, do

 sudo apt update

This will refresh our package lists but not actually install anything.

Then fetch the latest kp-report package via:

 cd /tmp
 wget https://feralsw.com/cdw/kp-report-latest.deb
 sudo apt install -y ./kp-report-latest.deb

Ignore and dismiss all alert boxes that will then show up before things
finish. As you continue along delete any popups asking to install updates.

2. System Control panel changes

Go to system settings.

Go to Ubuntu Desktop and shrink the taskbar icons and place the taskbar
on the bottom of the screen. Disable Home Folder on desktop.
Unpin 'A' window and help icons from taskbar on botton.

Search for Date & Time and disable automatic date and time.

Search for Privacy & Security
 Set under Screen Lock:
	+ 10 minutes blank screen delay
	+ Automatic Screen Lock ON
	+ Automatic Screen Lock delay 1 minute
	+ Lock Screen notifications ON
	+ Lock Screen on Suspend ON

 Set under Diagnostics:
	+ Send error reports to Canonical to NEVER

 

Fire up a Kconsole and pin it to the task bar:

#
# Set background to plain gray

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri none
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background primary-color gray

#

4. Upgrade kernel

#
# Upgrade kernel with updated amdgpu driver.
#

Upgrade the kernel packages to get the amdgpu driver fixes for multiple monitors.
This is built by hand elsewhere out of scope of these instructions.
